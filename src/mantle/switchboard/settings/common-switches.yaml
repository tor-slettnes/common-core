## Specifications for global, product-agnostic switches provided by the
## switchboard application itself.  Additional switches maybe defined by
## downstream/client applications, such as high-level instrument control
## applications for each product.
##
## Switches are listed in the "switches" section by name, following a subset
## of the following generic template (where applicable, defaults are indicated):
##
## @code{.yaml}
## switches:
##   - name: "Switch Name"
##     active: false
##     localizations:
##       - en:
##           text: "What this switch represents"
##           action texts:
##             ON: "turn this switch on"
##             OFF: "turn this switch off"
##           state texts:
##             ACTIVATING  : "this switch is activating"
##             ACTIVE      : "this switch is active"
##             DEACTIVATING: "this switch is deactivating"
##             INACTIVE    : "this switch is inactive"
##             FAILING     : "this switch is handling an error"
##             FAILED      : "this switch is encountered an error"
##
##     primary: false
##     dependencies:
##       - predecessor name: "Predecessor Switch Name"
##         trigger states: [ ACTIVE, INACTIIVE, FAILED ]
##         automatic: false
##         polarity: POSITIVE
##         hard: false
##         sufficient: false
##         attributes:
##           key1: true
##           key2: 2
##           key3: 3.141592653589793238
##           key4: "IV"
## @endcode
##
## The various texts may be used to compose user-facing or log messages. For instance, given this:
##
## @code{.yaml}
## switches:
##   - name: "Door:Open"
##     state texts:
##       ACTIVE: "the door is open"
##
##   - name: "Door:Locked"
##     action texts:
##       ON: "lock the door"
##     dependencies:
##       - name: "Door:Open"
##         polarity: NEGATIVE
##         automatic: false
##         hard: true
## @endcode
##
## An attempt to activate "Door:Locked" will fail if "Door:Open" is currently
## active.  By querying for the culprit (using e.g. `get_culprits()`) one might
## use a template like
##     "Cannot [state's target text] because [predecessor's state text]"
## to construct a message, in this case
##     "Cannot lock the door because the door is open".
##
## In addition to the above, a switch may have zero or more "interceptors"
## which are execution hooks invoked whenever it changes its state. For
## instance, a "Door:Lock" switch may have code to actually lock/unlock the door
## in its ACTIVATING/DEACTIVATING states.  These are added by
## applications at runtime.
##
## Generally, a switch's specification (like its status) may be updated at runtime; for 
## instance it may add or remove dependencies based on various conditions.
