        @param source:
            Either a HTTP/HTTPS URL or a VFS path specified in the format
            `CONTEXT:PATH`. If no source is specified, perform scan in the
            preconfigured/default locations.

        This call returns immediately, without waiting for the results of the
        scan. To observe scan progress and results, see `start_notify_signals()`.

        This call is not required for ongoing upgrade availability
        notifications.  By default, removable devices (e.g. USB drives) are
        scanned on insertion, and online checks are performed at regular
        intervals if an Internet connection is available.

          An optional HTTP/HTTPS URL or a VFS path to the specified in the
          format `CONTEXT:PATH`, pointing to the exact release package to
          install.

          whether to install the package even if its package_info declares a
          different product name than what is currently installed or its version
          number is older than the currently installed release.

        installed. To monitor the upgrade progress and result use the `watch()`
        method below.
