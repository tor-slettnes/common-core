        Initializer.

        @param address
            Depending on `role`, this should be a network interface address to
            which to bind (use `*` to denote all network interfaces), or a host
            address to which to connect.

        @param channel_name
            A name used to look up settings such as default host/interface
            address and port number for this endpoint.  Think of it as a
            generalized service name, adapted for RPC/Request/Response, Pub/Sub,
            and other ZMQ socket types.

        @param project_name
            Name of the overall code project, used to locate corresponding
            settings files (e.g. `zmq-endpoints-PROJECT.yaml`), in addition to
            `"common"`.
            (Since this is Python, it must be provided as a runtime argument
            rather than a pre-built default. Correspondingly, the meaing of
            "project" in this context is flexible; for instance, if your code
            repository is shared amongst multiple products, it could denote
            a specific one.)

        @param socket_type
            ZMQ socket type to use for this endpoint. Typically a hardcoded
            value is passed in from direct descendants of this class, e.g.
            `Publisher` would use `zmq.PUB`.

        @param role
            Default role of this endpoint vis a vis its peers.
            `Endpoint.Role.HOST` means that this will bind to one or all local
            network interfaces and listen for incoming connections, whereas
            `Endpoint.Role.SATELLITE` means that this will connect to a (local
            or remote) peer.  If not provided, an explicit call to `bind()` or
            `connect()` will be required in order to communicate with peers.
