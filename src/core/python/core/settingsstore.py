    def __init__(self,
                 filenames  : FilePath|FilePaths = [],
                 searchpath : FilePaths = None):

        '''Initialize a new SettingsStore instance from the specified JSON file(s).
        Any script-style or C++-style comments (prefixed with either `#` or `//`)
        are strippped off before parsing.

        @param[in] filenames
           A single JSON file or a list of JSON files from which to load initial
           settings.  If a `.json` suffix is missing, it is added.

        @param[in] searchpath
           A list of directories in which to look for relative filenames. Each
           directory name may be absolute or relative. In the latter case, an
           upward search for that (dominating) folder name starts at the
           installation folder where this module is located, and ends at the
           root of the filesystem.

        If `searchpath` is not not provided, it is obtained from the environment
        variable `CONFIGPATH`, where folder names are presumed to be separated
        by the OS-specific path separator (`:` on UNIX, `;` on Windows).

        If `CONFIGPATH` is not defined, the default search path comprises:
        * a per-unit configuration folder (`/etc/cc` on UNIX or `C:/CC` on Windows)
        * an application-provided default settings folder (`share/settings`), presumed
          relative to the top-level folder where the software is installed.

        For example, consider a deployment where this module is located
        somewhere inside `/opt/cc/share/python/`, and default configurations are
        stored in JSON files within the folder `/opt/cc/share/settings/`. 
        Let's say you create a SettingsStore instance as follows:

        ```
        my_settings = SettingsStore(
                          filenames = ['my_settings.json', 'factory_settings.json'])
        ```

        Since `searchpath` is not explicitly provided, the default value
        `['/etc/cc', 'share/settings']` is used.  Settings are then loaded
        and merged in from whichever of the following paths exist, in turn:

        1. `/etc/cc/my_settings.json`
        2. `/opt/cc/share/settings/my_settings.json`
        3. `/etc/cc/factory_settings.json`
        4. `/opt/cc/share/settings/factory_settings.json`

        See also `load_settings()`.
