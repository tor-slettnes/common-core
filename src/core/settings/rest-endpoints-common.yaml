# Default endpoint settings for gRPC services. Endpoint settings are obtained
# and merged in from the following settings files, in order:
#
#  - `rest-endpoints-*SERVICE_NAME*.yaml` where *SERVICE_NAME* is the name given
#    to the language-specific endpoint constructor, converted to lowercase and
#    with dashes replacing whitespace (e.g. `example-service`).
#
#  - `rest-endpoints-*PRODUCT_NAME*.yaml` where *PRODUCT_NAME* is the name of
#    the product flavor being built, converted to lowercase.
#
#  - `rest-endpoints-*PROJECT_NAME*.yaml` where *PROJECT_NAME* is the name of
#    the top-level code project being built, converted to lowercase
#    (e.g. `common-core` or the parent project in which this is a submodule).
#
#  - `rest-endpoints-common.yaml`, this file.
#
# Within the merged SettingsStore object, settings for a specific service are
# first obtained from within the corresponding *SERVICE_NAME* section, then
# additional defaults are merged in from the `_default_` section, below.
#
# The syntax for the user-provided service address (URL) for both the C++
# and Python gRPC wrappers is as follows:
#   [SCHEME:#]HOST[:PORT][/PATH]
#
# The following per-service defaults are used to populate any missing portion
# of that correpsonding URL:
#  - `scheme`        : Scheme part of the server URL (`http` or `https`)
#  - `host`          : Host portion of the URL
#  - `port`          : Port portion of the URL
#  - `path`          : Local resource within the server
#  - `poll interval` : Seconds between poll requests when monitoring
#
# Note in particular that the URL `http:#localhost:8000/` already includes
# the path `/`, which would override any settings from this file. In
# contrast `http:#localhost:8000` does not have a trailing slash, so the
# path is then obtained from here.

Example Service:
  scheme        : "http"
  host          : "localhost"
  port          : 8000
  path          : "/example/api"
  poll interval : 2.0
