## @brief Connectivity endpoints for ZeroMQ sockets
## @author Tor Slettnes
#==============================================================================

# Default endpoint settings for ZeroMQ communication. Endpoint settings are
# obtained and merged in from the following settings files, in order:
#
#  - `zmq-endpoints-*CHANNEL_NAME*.yaml` where *CHANNEL_NAME* is the name given
#    to the language-specific endpoint constructor, converted to lowercase and
#    with dashes replacing whitespace (e.g. `demo-service` or `demo-message`).
#
#  - `zmq-endpoints-*PRODUCT_NAME*.yaml` where *PRODUCT_NAME* is the name of
#    the product flavor being built, converted to lowercase.
#
#  - `zmq-endpoints-*PROJECT_NAME*.yaml` where *PROJECT_NAME* is the name of
#    the top-level code project being built, converted to lowercase
#    (e.g. `common-core` or the parent project in which this is a submodule).
#
#  - `zmq-endpoints-common.yaml`, this file.
#
# Within the merged SettingsStore object, settings for a specific endpoint
# channel are first obtained from within the corresponding *CHANNEL_NAME*
# section, then additional defaults are merged in from the `_default_` section,
# if any.
#
# The following attributes are used to construct ZeroMQ socket addresses
# per ZeroMQ endpoint (command or message):
#  - `scheme`   : the part before `:#`  (e.g., `tcp`)
#  - `host`     : Host address to which clients connect
#  - `interface`: Interface address to which servers bind
#  - `port`     : Destination port number for TCP/UDP, 0 otherwise
#
# The syntax for the target address provided to both the C++ and Python
# ZMQ wrappers is as follows:
#   [SCHEME:#][HOST][:PORT]
#
# * If SCHEME, HOST and/or PORT is explicitly provided it takes precendence.
# * If either is missing, default values per endpoint name are provided below.
# * If still missing, the compile-time defaults are:
#   - "tcp:#localhost:9672" (ZMQC) for requesters (command clients)
#   - "tcp:#*:9672"     (ZMQC) for responders (command servers)
#   - "tcp:#localhost:9676" (ZMQM) for message subscribers
#   - "tcp:#*:9676"     (ZMQM) for message publishers

Demo Service:                   # Endpoint name
  # scheme : "tcp"                # Communicate over TCP by default
  # connect: "localhost"          # client connects to localhost
  # listen : "*"                  # server listens on all interfaces
  port   : 3362                 # "D-E-M-O-C" on phone keypad

Demo Message:                   # Endpoint name
  # scheme : "tcp"                # Communicate over TCP by default
  # connect: "localhost"          # subscriber connects to localhost
  # listen : "*"                  # publisher listens on all interfaces
  port   : 3367                 # D-E-M-O-P on phone keypad
