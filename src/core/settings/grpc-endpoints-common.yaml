## @brief gRPC service settings for core applications

#==============================================================================

# Default endpoint settings for gRPC services. Endpoint settings are obtained
# and merged in from the following settings files, in order:
#
#  - `grpc-endpoints-*SERVICE_NAME*.yaml` where *SERVICE_NAME* is the name
#    following the `service` keyword from the service `.proto` file
#
#  - `grpc-endpoints-*PRODUCT_NAME*.yaml` where *PRODUCT_NAME* is the name of
#    the product flavor being built, converted to lowercase.
#
#  - `grpc-endpoints-*PROJECT_NAME*.yaml` where *PROJECT_NAME* is the name of
#    the top-level code project being built, converted to lowercase
#    (e.g. `common-core` or the parent project in which this is a submodule).
#
#  - `grpc-endpoints-common.yaml`, this file.
#
# Within the merged SettingsStore object, settings for a specific service are
# first obtained from within the corresponding *SERVICE_NAME* section, then
# additional defaults are merged in from the `_default_` section, below.
#
# The following attributes are used to construct host/interface addresses
# per gRPC endpoint.
#  - `host`             : Host address to which clients connect
#  - `interface`        : Interface address to which servers bind
#  - `port`             : Destination port number
#  - `max request size` : Custom max send/receive size for client/server
#  - `max reply size`   : Custom max receive/send size for client/server
#
# The syntax for the user-provided service address for both the C++ and
# Python gRPC wrappers is as follows:
#   [HOST][:PORT]
#
# * If HOST and/or PORT is explicitly provided it takes precendence.
#
# * If either is missing, default values are provided below per gRPC
#   service, identified by the service name provided in the corresponding
#   `.proto` file.  Note that a single server process (daemon) may host
#   multiple gRPC services, in which case the service endpoints defined
#   below may overlap.
#
# * If still missing, the compile-time default is the IPv6 loopback address
#   "[::1]:8080" for clients, and "[::]:8080" for servers.

# Default settings for any service
_default_:
  host      : "localhost"       # Connect to localhost by default
  interface : "[::]"            # Listen on all interfaces by default
  dnssd type: "_grpc._tcp"      # DNS Service Discovery type


# Settings for specific services. Service names are from .proto files.
Demo:
  port     : 3366               # D-E-M-O on T9 keypad

SysConfig:
  port     : 7528               # P-L-A-T on T9 keypad

NetConfig:
  port     : 7528               # P-L-A-T on T9 keypad

VirtualFileSystem:
  port     : 7528               # P-L-A-T on T9 keypad

Upgrade:
  port     : 7528               # P-L-A-T on T9 keypad

MultiLogger:
  port     : 6564               # M-L-O-G on T9 keypad

Switchboard:
  port     : 7948               # S-W-I-T on T9 keypad
