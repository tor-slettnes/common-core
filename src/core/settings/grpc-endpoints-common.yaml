## @brief gRPC service settings for core applications

#==============================================================================

# Default endpoints for common applications. In addtiion to these, settings for
# product-specific applications can be found in
# `grpc-services-PRODUCT_NAME.yaml`, where PRODUCT_NAME is provided at build
# time.
#
# The following attributes are used to construct host/interface addresses
# per gRPC endpoint.
#  - `host`             : Host address to which clients connect
#  - `interface`        : Interface address to which servers bind
#  - `port`             : Destination port number
#  - `max request size` : Custom max send/receive size for client/server
#  - `max reply size`   : Custom max receive/send size for client/server
#
# The syntax for the user-provided service address for both the C++ and
# Python gRPC wrappers is as follows:
#   [HOST][:PORT]
#
# * If HOST and/or PORT is explicitly provided it takes precendence.
#
# * If either is missing, default values are provided below per gRPC
#   service, identified by the service name provided in the corresponding
#   `.proto` file.  Note that a single server process (daemon) may host
#   multiple gRPC services, in which case the service endpoints defined
#   below may overlap.
#
# * If still missing, the compile-time default is the IPv6 loopback address
#   "[::1]:8080" for clients, and "[::]:8080" for servers.

# Default settings for any service
_default_:
  host      : "localhost"       # Connect to localhost by default
  interface : "[::]"            # Listen on all interfaces by default
  dnssd type: "_grpc._tcp"      # DNS Service Discovery type


# Settings for specific services. Service names are from .proto files.
